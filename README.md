# Swing Ball Game
This repository contains the C# script files used in a unity project. 
The project is a platformer-like game where the player controls a ball which can bounce and swing with a rope that it can attach onto obstacles. 
This code alone is not enough to make the game run effectively as the prefabs that use and are used by these scripts are not included.
The purpose of the repository is to have a backup and record of changes rather than to share the source.
